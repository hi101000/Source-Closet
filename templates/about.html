        <h1>About me and this site</h1>
        <p>I'm  a high school student in the USA who interested in both history and coding. Therefore, I thought I'd contribute my two cents
        to the history nerd community by creating this website. Here, you will find historical sources from across history (though focusing more on the 20th and 21st century).
        I really just upload the sources as I come across them. As such, the exact list of sources and the topic of new sources will be kind of biased
        by whatever I'm researching at the moment. Nonetheless, I hope to make a meaningful contribution to the lives of people around the world who have an interest in history
        and save them the hours of hair-pulling which I had to endure to find some of these sources. Feel free to contact me using the below details with any questions or concerns.
        I'll try to be prompt in my responses, but sometimes it might take me over a week to reply, due to my own personal schedule and business level.</p>
